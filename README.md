# NYC Air Quality Data Analysis and Predictions
## Description
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting air quality in New York City. Our goal is to provide residents with valuable insights into the environmental quality of their neighborhoods, highlighting the presence of various air pollutants. Using data sourced from NYC Open Data and other external datasets, we have developed a sophisticated model. This model not only tracks and visualizes historical air quality trends but also employs predictive analytics to forecast future air quality scenarios based on observed data patterns.

## How to Run
To launch the Dash application for visualizing the air quality data, run the `run_dash_app.py` file.

## Sources
- [**NYC Air Quality Dataset**](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r): This dataset provides comprehensive air quality surveillance data across different neighborhoods in New York City.
- [**NYC_geography**](https://github.com/nycehs/NYC_geography): A great resource for geographic boundaries of NYC, including the geoJSON files used for this project.

## Authors
- Veronica Koval

# To-Do
### Research
- Identify the particles that have a significant impact on air quality
- Determine acceptable levels for these particle concentrations
- Find external datasets to supplement our model

## Dash App
- Enhance the visual appeal of the app, focusing on user interface design and ease of use.
- Integrate predictive modeling features, enabling users to view potential future air quality scenarios based on historical data trends.
